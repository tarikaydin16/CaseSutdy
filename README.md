# Project1
While doing project1, I first created the grid on the UI and tried to make a match detection system. Afterwards, I converted the grids to plane objects. While doing the project, I made sure that it was optimized and error-free.
I took care to write explanations to make the code more understandable. Additionally, I took care to use Events and comply with SOLID principles while creating the architecture.

The basis of the algorithm is that if there is an "X" in a cell, that cell controls its 4 edges. If there is an x on at least one side, it adds the relevant cells to the "found cells" list. If the number of elements in this list is more than 3, it eliminates the Xs and increments the counter by one.

# Project2
While doing project 2, I first thought about how I could cut a stack object. The basis of the algorithm is that it creates two objects with the same size as the percentage of an object to be cut. For example, let's say 40% is cut. He creates two objects that are 40% and 60% the size of the uncut object and places them appropriately.While doing this project, I paid attention to documentation and other coding principles.
I also ensured that my project was optimized as much as possible by using **MaterialProperty block**  and **object pooling** .I used cinemachine for camera events.
